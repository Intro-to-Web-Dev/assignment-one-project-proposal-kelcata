           <p> My goals that I wish for my site to achieve are: </p>
           <ol>
               <li>To help make NFL fans aware of the team.</li>
               <li>To provide information about the Houston Texans.</li>
               <li>To help its declining fan base grow again.</li>
           </ol>

           <p> I would like to model the Minnesota Vikings site for the layout of my site. I like their site and would like to model it not only because I am also a Vikings fan but because their site shows all the information you would need as a fan. Also, because it is a bold site that has interactive images that act as links. Another reason I would like to model this site is because it is easy to navigate making it more interesting and fun to be on.</p>

           <p> Content Pages </p>
           <ol>
               <li>I would like to have one page that contains the Texans News so fans can keep up with what is happening during the season and during the off season. This page will also show weekly highlights from games, injuries, and other important happenings.</li>
               <li>Another page will contain information about their schedule. This page will also have a link for viewers to see the schedule on the Texans site and a ticket purchase link.</li>
               <li>I would also like for one of my pages to have information about the team itself, how it started, where their name came from, and other historical facts of the team that would interest fans.</li>
               <li>One page will also have brief bios about key players of the team. This will help fans learn and become more interested in the payers.</li>
               <li>Lastly, I would like a page for images and videos of great plays. This will let viewers see just how cool the Texans really are.</li>
           </ol>
           <hr>
           <p>The intended audience of this website will be (but not limited to) football fans looking for a team to root for, people curious about the changes to the Texans, Existing fans, and broadcasters.</p>
